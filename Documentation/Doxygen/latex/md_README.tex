Bezier curve is a curve of degree n with n+1 control points. This project aims to implement a bezier curve using de casteljau\textquotesingle{}s algorithm in Open\+GL.

\subsection*{Algorithm}

Lerp is recursively applied to the control points until it converges to a single point.

Addition of point\+: Add\textquotesingle{}s x,y to the 2D control array.

Deletion of point\+: Removes x,y from the 2D control array within a T\+O\+U\+C\+H\+\_\+\+B\+U\+F\+F\+ER range.

Dragging a point\+: Stores previous touch and current point on lift off within the T\+O\+U\+C\+H\+\_\+\+B\+U\+F\+F\+ER and changes the point.

t is controlled using R\+ES parameter in the code.
